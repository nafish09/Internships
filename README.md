# AI/ML Internship | NDV Techsys

This repository contains the projects and technical implementations completed during my AI/ML internship at NDV Techsys. The work focuses on data-driven decision-making and predictive modeling using industry-standard tools.

## Key Responsibilities
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and anomalies in raw datasets.
* Developed and optimized machine learning models using Scikit-learn and Python.
* Implemented data cleaning and preprocessing pipelines to ensure high model accuracy.
* Evaluated model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, Git

## Project Highlights
* **Predictive Analysis:** Built models to forecast outcomes based on historical data features.
* **Feature Engineering:** Selected and transformed variables to improve model efficiency.

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the notebooks to view the step-by-step analysis.
